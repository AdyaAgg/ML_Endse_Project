## Crisis Detection Through X (Formerly Twitter)
In crisis situations, timely information is crucial for situational awareness and effective response. Social media, especially Twitter, offers real-time updates on disaster developments, recovery, and preparedness. This study leverages
machine learning to automatically classify crisis-related tweets, enhancing disaster management strategies. We evaluated multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP and CNN. Our
findings show that ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost, and MLP offer higher F1 score and scalability, making them suitable for real-time crisis detection.
We developed a web-based tool to extract live Tweets, and classify them as disaster or not.
